## About PYNQ

PYNQ is an open-source project from Xilinx that makes it easy to design embedded systems with Zynq All Programmable Systems on Chips (APSoCs). Using the Python language and libraries, designers can exploit the benefits of programmable logic and microprocessors in Zynq to build more capable and exciting embedded systems. PYNQ users can now create high performance embedded applications with

parallel hardware execution
high frame-rate video processing
hardware accelerated algorithms
real-time signal processing
high bandwidth IO
low latency control
See the [PYNQ webpage](http://www.pynq.io/) for an overview of the project, and find [documentation on ReadTheDocs](http://pynq.readthedocs.io/) to get started.
